        <h2>HELPING WRITERS TAKE THEIR WORK TO THE NEXT LEVEL</h2>
        <h3>Services</h3>
        <p id="services">I provide writers the sharp eye of a seasoned editor, the gut reactions of an avid reader, and the invested interest of a supportive friend. Whether you're seeking the broad guidance of an editorial assessment or the nuts-and-bolts feedback of a developmental edit, you will receive an honest evaluation of your work and a deeper understanding of the tools and techniques that will allow your story to shine.</p>

            <div class="box1"><h4><img src="glasses.png" alt="Image of glasses" id="glasses">GENERAL CRITIQUE</h4>
                <p class="text">Are your characters compelling? Is their behavior credible? Is the story well-paced? Does the plot have tension? Will readers care enough to finish the book?
                I’ll carefully read your manuscript and provide an editorial letter examining the work’s strengths and weaknesses and suggesting ways and means for improvement.</p></div>
            <div class="box2"><h4><img src="magnifyingglass.png" alt="Image of a magnifying glass" id="magnifying"> LINE EDIT</h4>
                <p class="text">Once a manuscript has undergone a developmental edit and is structurally sound, I’ll polish and fine-tune your prose so it reads more fluidly.</p></div>
            <div class="box3"> <h4><img src="typewriter.png" alt="Image of a typewriter" id="typewriter"> DEVELOPMENTAL EDIT</h4>
                <p class="text">For writers who’d like a deeper level of feedback. I’ll read your manuscript several times, providing margin comments throughout the text, pointing out specific issues, asking questions, letting you know which lines sing, and providing prompts to help you deepen the characterization and storytelling. </p></div>
